## Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)

-   National Cancer Institute (NCI)
-   Digital health technology use
-   Health information-seeking behavior
-   Cancer awareness and preventive health practices

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Questions

-   RQ1: How do **demographic and socio-economic factors** differ between telehealth users and non-users?
-   RQ2: How do **social media usage frequency and health information engagement levels** differ between telehealth users and non-users?
-   RQ3: How do **cancer-related risk perceptions** differ between telehealth users and non-users?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RQ1. Demographic Factors and Telehealth Usage

::: incremental
### My Journey

-   The dataset includes variables on age group, gender, ethnicity, education, income, and telehealth care usage.

-   Column names were renamed for consistency and clarity. Responses were recoded into numeric scales, and missing values were effectively removed.

-   Visualizations, including bar plots and summary tables, were generated to illustrate demographic patterns and telehealth usage.
:::

::: incremental
### Challenges I Faced

-   Cleaning and restructuring the dataset (e.g., handling missing data for variables like Telehealth usage, Ethnicity, etc.).

-   Re-encoding and categorizing variables (e.g., grouping income ranges, recoding gender and ethnicity categories).

-   Managing discrepancies between data types during transformation (pivot_longer and pivot_wider).

### Victories to Celebrate

-   Successfully created a clean dataset with well-defined variables (e.g., Age, Gender, Education, Income, Ethnicity).

-   Generated insightful visualizations to represent telehealth usage distribution across demographics.

-   Comprehensive summary statistics table highlighting demographic distributions and telehealth service usage.

### Continuing Challenges

-   Improving the readability and interpretability of demographic summaries for broader audiences.

-   Refining visualizations to emphasize critical findings without overwhelming the audience.

-   Addressing minor inconsistencies in the summarized percentages.
:::

::: incremental
### Next R Hurdle

-   Incorporating inferential statistical techniques (e.g., chi-square tests) to assess relationships between demographics and telehealth usage.

-   Exploring interaction effects between variables like income and education on telehealth adoption.

-   Automating summary and visualization processes for scalability.

## RQ2. Social Media Usage Frequency/Health Information Social Media Engagement and Telehealth Usage

**How do social media usage frequency and health information engagement levels on social media differ between Telehealth users and non-users?**

## RQ2. SMF/Health Info SM Engagement

::: incremental
### My Journey

-   Created a small dataset: select(), rename(), mutate(), recode(), filter()
-   Grouped data by HI SM engagement level: group_by(), pivot_longer()
-   Created graphs for analysis: ggplot(), geom_bar()
-   Calculated descriptive statistics: summarize()
-   Created tables: pivot_wider(), group_by()

### Findings

-   For SMF (*M* = 3.94, *SD* = 1.49 for Users, *M* = 3.60, *SD* = 1.68 for Non-Users), the same pattern was observed.
-   **Almost every day** (58% vs. 50%) \> **Never (15% vs. 24%)** \> At least once a week (13% vs.12%) \> A few times a month (8% vs. 7%) \> Less than once a month (6% vs. 6%)
:::

::: incremental
### Findings

-   For HI SM engagement level(*M* = 4.9, *SD* = 2.16 for Users, *M* = 4.26, *SD* = 1.71 for Non-Users), the same pattern was found.
-   The vast majority belonged to the **Low group (83% vs. 91%)**, followed by the Medium (15% vs. 8%), and then the High (3% vs. 1%).

## RQ3. Cancer Risk Perception and Telehealth Usage

**How do cancer-related risk perceptions differ between telehealth users and non-users?**

## RQ3. Cancer Risk Perception and Telehealth Usage

::: incremental
### My Journey

-   selected relevant columns (cancer risk perception: screening willingness, worry, susceptibility, beliefs about causes, prevention feasibility)

-   renamed variables into simpler names

-   recoded responses into consistent numeric scales
:::

::: incremental
### My Journey

-   cleaned missing or inapplicable data

-   combined cancer risk perception factors into a single variable and categorized them into three levels (low, medium, and high) based on their average point

-   created data visualization and summary statistics tables
:::

::: incremental
### Challenges I Faced, but Succeeded

-   data cleaning: recoding several variables that had different criteria into a consistent numeric formats without any mistakes

-   grouping data: calculating averages across multiple columns using mutate()

-   visualization: using 'dodge' position in geom_bar

### Substantive Findings

-   Regardless of cancer risk perception level, there are more people who have never used telehealth than those who have.

:::

::: incremental
### Substantive Findings

-   Individuals with higher risk perceptions are more likely to have used telehealth compared to those with lower risk perceptions.

:::

::: incremental
### Substantive Findings

-   Still, People with high cancer risk perception tend to use telehealth less than those with medium risk perception.

::: incremental
### Continuing Challenges

-   Refining the grouping criteria for low, medium, and high based on their average scores? or sum scores?
:::

::: incremental
### Next R Hurdle

-   Learning how to conduct more complicated statistical analysis to deepen understanding of the relationship between cancer risk perception and telehealth usage, beyond the distribution
